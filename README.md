🐾 Animal Footprints Classification






This project classifies different animal footprints using Machine Learning / Deep Learning techniques.
It helps identify animals based on the patterns of their footprints.

📌 Project Overview

Animal footprints provide valuable information about wildlife presence and behavior.
This system analyzes footprint images and predicts the animal type with high accuracy.

🎯 Features

Upload footprint images

Automatic animal classification

High accuracy using trained models

Easy-to-use interface

🧰 Technologies Used

Python 3.10

TensorFlow / PyTorch

OpenCV

NumPy & Pandas

Machine Learning / Deep Learning

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains images of various animal footprints including:

Animal	Number of Images
Tiger	200
Leopard	150
Elephant	100
Deer	180
Dog	250

You can replace these numbers with your actual dataset counts.

🖼 Screenshots

Sample Input & Output:

Input Image	Predicted Result

	Tiger (98% confidence)

	Elephant (95% confidence)

Note: Add your images in a screenshots/ folder in the project and update paths.
